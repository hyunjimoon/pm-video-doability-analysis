## [00:00:00] Introduction

**Andres:** Product management students, my name is Andres. I'm one of your TAs for this class, and today I'm going to be introducing briefly the project that we have thought for this class.

So, as many of you may know, the product management project for this semester involves ideating, but also creating a prototype—a working prototype of the app, product or feature that's for your MBA community.

---

## [00:01:00] What is Vibe-Coding?

**Andres:** So some of you might be thinking right now, do I need any coding capabilities or any coding skills for me to actually do this project? The short answer is no. And the reason why you won't need this is because we're gonna be leveraging vibe-coding tools—tools that are able to translate natural language into code. So natural language meaning just plain English into working code.

And we are proposing you to use **Lovable** and **Cursor**, which have become the industry standards in the vibe-coding community. However, feel free to use any vibe-coding tools that you might be used to or that you might know or that you might want to try.

However, whatever tools you choose to use, one tool that's gonna be required for this project is **GitHub**. GitHub is not a coding tool, but think of it like the Google Drive for the code that's gonna be generated from these tools.

---

## [00:02:00] The Deliverable

**Andres:** So the final deliverable from this project is the GitHub repository that you're gonna be sharing with your TAs so that TAs can actually use your tool and grade the solution that you all have been working on throughout this semester.

So Lovable works great when you have this idea in mind. Think about Cursor as your software engineer friend. The way Cursor works is whatever your code base might be, you can go into Cursor and tell the app "I want to do this change," and then Cursor will do those changes into the code base.

---

## [00:03:00] Why GitHub?

**Andres:** The reason why we need GitHub is that, as you are gonna see, the code that's gonna be generated by Lovable is not just one script—it's actually many, many different files. And the industry standard way to keep track of these files is to upload them into GitHub. And within GitHub you can keep track of the changes of the different features or changes that have been done in the app, and GitHub becomes this source of truth or base code of the app, which gives the master version of the code.

So what we're gonna do is:
1. Create a simple app through Lovable
2. Put all the files in GitHub
3. Connect our GitHub repository into Cursor
4. Make some changes in Cursor
5. Send those changes back to GitHub

---

## [00:04:00] Using Lovable

**Andres:** So now let's get into more of the details on how to use the apps. Lovable works as a webpage. You actually engage with Lovable through **lovable.dev**.

So I'm just gonna provide this context to Lovable. As you can see, the way this works is a really familiar chatbot interface that we are used to from ChatGPT or Gemini. Lovable takes our prompt, and then it starts thinking about how it's gonna design this tool. It might provide us with some questions that Lovable might have for it to create this tool.

If it doesn't have any questions, then it's gonna go directly into creating the solution. One thing that you have to keep in mind is that Lovable creates **web apps**, and what that means is that the front end that Lovable is gonna create is gonna be based in HTML. So all of the apps that it creates are viewable through any web browser.

---

## [00:05:00] Lovable Demo Result

**Andres:** All right, so now you can see what Lovable created, and this is the preview of what Lovable has created. And as you can see, I can click through my app and see the functionality of the features that I have designed. You can see that these are not dummy features, but they actually work.

---

## [00:06:00] When to Use Cursor

**Andres:** As I said before, you can even go and tell Lovable, "Hey, I need to do these changes on the app." That works really well. However, if you want to do some code-heavy changes, then it might not work as great, and that's where Cursor might be a little bit more useful. So that's the tool we're gonna be using for this project or for this demo of how we think you should be building the project.

Before we get into that, I just wanted to show you—this is the app, this is the preview, right? But all the code that's created for this app to work is in the **Code** tab. And as you can see, it's not one or two files. It's actually many files, which proves how good these vibe-coding tools have become. Because in just a minute or so, we were able to create this much code and create a great looking app that before would have taken us maybe a week or so of engineering resources to build.

---

## [00:07:00] Connecting to GitHub

**Andres:** So one thing that you'll notice is that within Lovable, getting your project to GitHub is quite easy. You have here your **Connect to GitHub** button. So once you've created your GitHub repository, you can actually click in here, connect your GitHub repository, and you can say "Connect Project."

And when you connect the project to your GitHub repository, you're gonna see that you're gonna have a new repository created in your GitHub base. So if I go into here, as you can see, we didn't have this "MIT Cohort Finder" before, but now when I click on it, I can see that all the different files that were created by Lovable are now included into my GitHub repository.

---

## [00:08:00] Install Git First

**Andres:** One little thing that you should also know before moving forward with Cursor is you should also **install Git**. Git is the way in which GitHub interacts with the local files. So if you run into any kind of problems, first install Git before creating your GitHub account.

So now we have a basic structure of our app. Now we can go into Cursor to actually see a little bit more about the code, but actually see how Cursor works and how we can actually create some changes within our created app.

---

## [00:09:00] Cloning to Cursor

**Andres:** So the easiest way to do this is to **clone your repository**. The same way you can connect your GitHub repository in Lovable, you can do in Cursor. It's just a matter of providing your login and password.

Once you do that, you're gonna be able to see all the different projects that are in your GitHub repository, and you can actually click through the one we just created. You need to provide Cursor with a folder in which to save all these files. So I'm just gonna put here "Demo Product Management Project."

So you create a folder within your local files, you select that as a repository, and what it does is that Cursor is gonna download all the files that were created by Lovable into your computer, so it can actually work within the code base that you have provided.

---

## [00:10:00] Using Cursor Chat

**Andres:** So once you have this, what I really like to do is to get a sense of how my app works. And the way you can do that is within Cursor, you're gonna have this **New Chat** tab here, which is how you engage with Cursor.

And I told you before, think of Cursor as a software engineer friend that's always available to explain things to you, but also to do changes in the app as you see fit. So in here, I can go ahead and tell Cursor: **"Explain to me how my app works and what my files do."**

So you engage with Cursor in natural language and you can see how Cursor is then gonna go through your code base, read through all the different files that Lovable created, and then it's gonna tell you, "Hey look, this is what I found." So it's really useful for you to see, "Hey, these are the files that Lovable created. Now I want to understand how this app works." And Cursor does that really easy for you by just having a chatbot interface.

---

## [00:11:00] Running the App Locally

**Andres:** How can we go from this code to the actual app that we saw in Lovable? To do this, we're gonna go into a terminal. You open a terminal by going to **Terminal → New Terminal** in Cursor.

And then you're gonna run this command that's called:

```bash
npm install
```

What `npm install` does is it installs all the libraries and the repositories that were needed for us to actually run the app. And once it does that, you can go ahead and say:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And what this does is it creates a localhost in your computer in which you are gonna be able to see the app that we created in Lovable.

---

## [00:12:00] Making Changes with Cursor

**Andres:** So this is the exact app we created in Lovable, and you can see I can click through it, I can engage with it. I can see all the functionalities that I passed through Lovable, live here in the app.

And what's really useful right now is that once you thought about your customer journey, there might be some customer journey changes that you want to do on your app, or there might be some design changes that you might do on your app that we're gonna be doing through Cursor.

---

## [00:13:00] Example: Adding a Logo

**Andres:** As a matter of example, let's say this app would look better if I had my MIT logo here, right? So I'm just gonna go ahead and search "MIT Sloan logo", search for a logo. This is a good logo, and I know that I can copy the link address of this image.

So the way I would go about that is I can go into Cursor and actually say: **"I want my app to have on the upper right corner an MIT logo that is on this URL."**

---

## [00:14:00] Cursor Makes the Changes

**Andres:** And what you're gonna see is that Cursor works so well with natural language that it takes your input, it plans the next moves. Since you already told Cursor to explain how this app works, it already has in the context what files should it change, so it knows what to do. Think of Cursor as a software engineer friend that's always available to do the changes for you.

So you can see it's just working through those changes, and when everything's done, it's gonna tell you, "Hey, I made the changes. Everything is good." And now we can go back to our app and we can see that it now created the MIT Management logo.

---

## [00:15:00] Iterating on Changes

**Andres:** It has put it here. I wanted it here, so I can go ahead and say: **"I want it to be on the left side of this text."**

Now, Cursor works as good as the prompt you provide it. So whenever you provide it with an ambiguous prompt, as the first prompt that I gave, then you can see it makes some decisions that might not be the right ones. So it put the logo first on the right-hand side of the app.

But if you run into those problems, you can actually have a conversation with Cursor, and finally it's gonna be understanding what the changes that you're trying to do actually entail. So now you can see that by just providing natural language to Cursor, Cursor was able to do the change that I wanted.

---

## [00:16:00] Cursor Can Do More

**Andres:** Now, this was a simple change, but think that Cursor can also do more structural changes like creating different screens. Maybe I want an "Add Contact" but I can also want a "Delete Contact" button here. So those kind of changes that you have thought during your customer journey plan, you can build those changes with Cursor.

I was just trying to show you a simple example to see how Cursor works and how you should engage with Cursor within your project.

So within Cursor, you have to work on all the changes that you've thought about that entail a beautiful customer journey and that captures all the PRDs that you have thought about before in your ideation stage of the project.

---

## [00:17:00] Pushing to GitHub

**Andres:** But at the end, as I have previously mentioned, what we are expecting you to provide us is the GitHub repository in which all these changes were made. So all the things you've done in Cursor up to now are saved in the repository that we created on the beginning in our computer. So all the changes are local to the files within our computer.

So the next step, after you do all the changes in Cursor, what you have to do is have these changes reflected on your GitHub repository. And the way we go about doing that is we create a new terminal and we run these commands:

```bash
git status
```

Git status is gonna tell you what we have modified. So in here it tells us, "Hey, you have modified the index.tsx file," which we did to change the MIT logo appearance.

So we now have to add these changes to our repository:

```bash
git add .
```

Which basically means that all these changes are gonna be added.

---

## [00:18:00] Git Commit and Push

**Andres:** And then we're gonna do our first git commit:

```bash
git commit -m "Add the MIT logo to the app"
```

So basically this command is saying that we're gonna be making this commit to the Git repository. We can put a comment on what this change was. This is not needed for the project, but think if you were working in a real company with many engineers working on the app at the same time—having a little comment of what the commit is about is really useful.

So once you do that, then you can finally put your final Git command that's gonna be pushing these changes to the source code:

```bash
git push origin main
```

This is a really strong command because it's gonna alter your GitHub code permanently. So be sure that whenever you run this command, it's because all the changes you've done in your Cursor code base were the ones you really wanted. Because going back from this change is hard.

---

## [00:19:00] Closing

**Andres:** Once you do that, your GitHub repository was changed with the changes you've done in your Cursor tool. And now that GitHub repository is the one you're gonna be sharing with your TAs.

So this was a brief introduction about the kind of tools you are expected to be using during the project.

Any questions, comments, or problems you are having with building the project, feel free to shoot an email to any of your TAs and they'll be happy to answer any of your questions.

All right, thank you all.
